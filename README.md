# d2_content_editor

## Features

> Now we can add and delete unit resistances (still have to reload unit by its id to change the frames)

> All the values of sources, classes and reaches are binded on their catalogues and available to change

## BUGS

> rollback still doesn't work - need to find a way how to get field names from Record object
